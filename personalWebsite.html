            <p>Hello, my name is Saksham Shrestha. I am currently studying at Herald College Kathmandu, Naxal.<br>I am about to complete the first 
                semester of my level 4(year 1).<br> I am an individual with a diverse set of skills and interests. 
                My core skills include problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication.<br> I also have experience and knowledge 
                in various fields such as technology, web development, and 3d modeling. <br><br>
                My key achievements so far include winning a science project that was held at my school. <br>This event enabled me to do more research about 
                implementing AI on robots and develop the habit of improving what is already good to make it better.  <br><br>
                In the future, I plan to continue to develop my skills and knowledge in technology and web development as I seek to become a full-stack web developer.<br>
                 Additionally, I hope to take on more leadership roles in my community and positively impact society.
